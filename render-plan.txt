bot changes:

* When running, the bot will accept a flag --history
* While in history mode it will keep the last N json blobs representation of all events. Events are:
    * candle
    * trade
    * trade confirm
    * value change
    * indicator

(this might be a good time to consider state as separate and change the the bot to pure functional)

* --log will also log the history to console or file (or s3?)

* bot will also open a webserver on some port the webservers only target will take the history collection
and run it through plotly to create:

* Candle, bollingers, trade events (buy/sell red/green)

* The three portfolio values, original, hodl, bot over time
