# min-crypto

The absolute minimum amount of code I can write to have a functional crypto trader/backtester

Will trade. Back tester in flight. This code is a work in flight, adopt with caution.


TECH TODO:
* ~~Can you download eth usd to backtest db?~~
* Prettier
* TypeScript
* TS Lint


FEATURE TODO:

* stop loss on portfolio value
    > if current holdings have lost more then N% of their value, then we dump
* calculate and include fees live and in backtest
* live gdax smoke run (are we functional - no)
